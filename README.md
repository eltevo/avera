Abstract

According to the separate universe conjecture, spherically symmetric sub-regions in an
isotropic universe behave like mini-universes with their own cosmological parameters. This is
an excellent approximation in both Newtonian and general relativistic theories. We estimate
local expansion rates for a large number of such regions, and use a scale parameter calculated
from the volume-averaged increments of local scale parameters at each time step in an otherwise
standard cosmological N-body simulation. The particle mass, corresponding to a coarse
graining scale, is an adjustable parameter. This mean field approximation neglects tidal forces
and boundary effects, but it is the first step towards a non-perturbative statistical estimation
of the effect of non-linear evolution of structure on the expansion rate. Using our algorithm,
a simulation with an initial Omega_m = 1 Einstein–de Sitter setting closely tracks the expansion
and structure growth history of the Lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) cosmology. Due to small but
characteristic differences, our model can be distinguished from the LCDM model by future
precision observations. Moreover, our model can resolve the emerging tension between local
Hubble constant measurements and the Planck best-fitting cosmology. Further improvements
to the simulation are necessary to investigate light propagation and confirm full consistency
with cosmic microwave background observations.
